I started with one modest task on a website and our relationship grew into their deeper involvement at my request.  As I was branching out into previously unknown territory for me, they provided very useful advice as well as services. Remember, very clear instructions bring the best results, of course!  They will be happy to prove themselves to you the same way as they did for me, a step at a time!`,

I trust this company with all of my websites and we’ll continue to use them as we grow. Thanks, Jas!!`,

    description: `I like to take this review as a chance to thank Jass and his amazing team, Webguruz. Because I am continually stunned by their work. I am creating a big video course, which includes building a website, a membership site, and an affiliate system to work with affiliates. They are creative in designing and technically sound enough to work on it. Now I’m not the easiest customer to work with. I work everything out in the very smallest details. After that, as I am in a learning process myself to create all this, I keep adjusting things, or even changing things completely, which impacts things that are already set up and complicates the work for everyone. I know this mustn’t be easy for them. But still, nothing changes in their attitude. All this time they had a very professional, and even supportive attitude toward my project. I am really satisfied with their work so far, the layout of my website is beautiful. I feel I am receiving more than what I am paying for. But what I love most, is that Jass and his team are not just doing their job, you know, they are really engaged and truly have a heart for their clients. I know I will have a lifetime relationship working with Webguruz Technologies. Thank you for your outstanding work!!!`,
