      <h2>Business Analysis</h2>
<p>Learning a client’s business before embarking on an SEO project is as crucial as the relationship between fuel and engine. Ariad Partners will take a deep dive into your business goals and value propositions, online demand of product and services, website architecture, and competitors. The outcome will provide the baseline for other phases of SEO project.</p>

<h3>Identify Your Target Audience</h3>
<p>The first step in smart SEO is knowing who you’re trying to reach. We’ll provide an in-depth analysis of your target market. We will also create buyer personas so we can identify exactly who you want to visit your site and buy from you.</p>

<h3>SEO Audit Website Code and Content</h3>
<p>Not sure if you’re on track with your current website efforts? We will review your website, analyzing your current technical SEO issues and content, and provide suggestions for improvement.</p>

<h3>Research Targeted Keywords</h3>
<p>It’s not just about having keywords on your website, but about having the right keywords. Our team of SEO professionals will dig to find the best keywords to attract your target audience, then we will implement them in your web copy, create an architecture based on search demand, and build wireframes which address searcher queries.</p>

<h3>Assess the Competition</h3>
<p>It’s important to stay abreast of what your competitors are up to. We will look at their SEO, keywords, content marketing and pay-per-click activities, and make recommendations for you to help you beat the competition.</p>`,

      <h2>SEO Strategy</h2>
<p>In this phase of the project we will outline an SEO strategy that comprises of on site SEO, content strategy, off site SEO strategy, and search analytics.</p>

<h3>On-Site SEO Strategy</h3>
<p>Once we know your business and existing issues of your website that are preventing you from achieving your business goals, we will create an actionable SEO plan to make changes to the website code and content.</p>

<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
<p>To attract, engage, and convert your target audience, you need a strong content strategy and website architecture, otherwise you might end up attracting traffic that won’t convert on your website. We will create search-friendly content recommendations to maximize your online opportunities based on the personas we have developed. If necessarily, we will create wireframes of the architecture that meets all audience goals, searcher demands, and market opportunities. Next, we create a content schedule for your website, develop content marketing campaigns, update your social media, and publish press releases.</p>

<h3>Off-Site SEO Strategy</h3>
<p>Referral traffic from websites in your niche can help your website be discovered by your target audience. We will identify potential websites that can help drive referral traffic that converts on your website.</p>

<h3>SEO Analytics Strategy</h3>
<p>It’s important to measure the outcome of SEO campaigns, as it helps to fuel future search marketing campaigns. We will determine the primary and secondary goals for your SEO efforts and monitor your analytics to ensure you reach these goals.</p>`,

<p>In this phase, we will implement the off-site SEO strategy and create fresh content to drive referral traffic and engage new as well as returning visitors to your website.</p>

<h3>Create Content</h3>
<p>One of the best tools to boost your SEO is content. Fresh, recurring articles that your audience finds useful will attract more quality leads to your website. But we understand: you’re too busy to write the content yourself. Let our team of professional writers do it for you.</p>

<h3>Manage Social Media</h3>
<p>Another essential component of your SEO strategy is social media. But it’s not a one-time activity; social media requires ongoing maintenance and updates, and our team is ready to make your brand the thought leader in your industry on social channels like Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and Facebook.</p>

<h3>Public Relations</h3>
<p>Spreading newsworthy content through press releases, blogger outreach, news, and industry channels will help you to receive more exposure, referral traffic, and links to your website. Our outreach managers can help you optimize and promote your newsworthy content across your target audience.</p>`,
